I am a Computer Science student at [Ozyegin University](www.ozyegin.edu.tr) in Istanbul, Turkey.  
I am interested in Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience and Robotics.  
Currently, I am working with [Assist. Prof. Erhan Oztop](http://ozurobotics.ozyegin.edu.tr/eoztop/) at [OzU](www.ozyegin.edu.tr).

During Summer 2013, I will be working at [KU IUI Lab](http://iui.ku.edu.tr/).

Previously, I co-founded [Yapanzi.com](www.yapanzi.com) which is a marketplace for services people can offer.  
Yapanzi reached more than 3000 registered users and 20 transactions per day.  
If you want to learn more about Yapanzi, you can read [this article](http://www.webrazzi.com/2011/05/31/yapanzi/) on [Webrazzi](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/webrazzi), or watch [this video](http://vimeo.com/25727376) recorded by [eTohum](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/etohum).

After Yapanzi, I worked at [PromoQube](http://www.promoqube.com) and developed products for more effective social media use. 
Later, I worked at [Useful Ideas](http://www.usefulideas.net) and managed the product team. I worked on all aspects of [Hesaplabakalim.com](http://hesaplabakalim.com) which is a new generation calculator.

I started my university education studying Mechanical Engineering at [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr).  
Then I transferred to Ozyegin University to satisfy my interest in Computer Science.

I like reading non-fiction books. You can have a look at [the books I have read recently](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5798428-eren-sezener?shelf=read).
