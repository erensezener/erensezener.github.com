I have few productivity applications for Mac that I cannot live without.  
One of them is [Alfred App](http://alfredapp.com).  

I was always frustrated with the number of steps required to open a project folder with a text editor.  

So I developed [this Alfred extension](/open-with-sublime-text) which enables you to open any folder or file quickly with Sublime Text using Alfred.  

It is a very simple extension which saves you few seconds everytime you want to open a project folder.

Note: I did not try the extionsion with Alfred v2 yet.
