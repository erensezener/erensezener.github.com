From [my answer on Quora](http://www.quora.com/Tips-and-Hacks-for-Everyday-Life/What-are-the-top-10-or-so-statistics-or-facts-that-you-have-memorized-and-use-to-guide-your-life-and-decisions/answer/Eren-Sezener?__snids__=108363132&__nsrc__=1):  

When I was working on a 9 to 7 job, I did not have any time to do other things such as working on a fun project, learning something new or writing a blog. So I wanted to figure out how much time is actually usable per week.  

It is **100 hours/week** at most.  

The way I calculate is:  
={7 days/week} * [ {24 hours/day} - {Daily sleep duration} - {Immutable habits} - {Garbage time} ]
  
**Immutable habits** include the daily activities which you could not (or would not want to) sustain yourself without. i.e. hygiene activities, eating.
  
**Garbage time** includes the activities which are not vital, but you have to spend time doing those anyways. i.e. cleaning and organizing your place, walking the dog, dressing up.
  
If you are working on a full-time job, when you subtract all work related activities such as office time, commute and emails from 100 hours, the time left is really valuable. You want to spend it, not waste it.
